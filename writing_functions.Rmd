## Z-scores!

Let's compute the z-score version of a list of numbers.

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(25, mean = 7, sd = 4)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

Suppose you want to do this often.

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  z
}
```

```{r}
z_scores(x = x_vec)

z_scores(x = 1:10)
z_scores(x = rbinom(1000, 1, 0.6))
z_scores(x = 3)
```
